# About Package Managing

## package.json

The easiest way to descript this is a package reminder.

1. `npm init` to make package.json in your working directory
2. type in the form
   <br>Done.
   <br>If you wanna skip project specifying, type `npm init -y`.

## package installing

`npm i <package name>` to install packages

- -D option for Development Dependencies
- -g option for installing globally

For example, if you want to use "rimraf" package that works as rm -rf in Linux as a commander, just type `npm i -g rimraf`

## Version System : Semantic Versioning(SemVer)

Let's dive into package.json.
<br>You can see three numbers after package between dots.
<br>First number means Major version. That contains irreplaceable changes.
<br>Second number means Minor version. That is backward compatible.
<br>Third number means Patch. Contains small bug fixes.
<br>Signs in front of version number.
<br>^ Automatically installs in same Major version (Minor version can be different)
<br>~ Automatically installs in same Minor version (Patch version can be different)
<br>>, <, >=, <=, = means above, below, or above, or under
